# Hello

## Hi

#### idk what to write

---

## Quick about me:
- Just a normal 16-year-old going through life.
- I don’t code out of passion. I do it when I’m paid, pestered, or pissed off. It’s rarely my best, but still cleaner than whatever Frankenstein mess ChatGPT warriors cook up after three coffee-fueled all-nighters.


---

## Quick story on how I started coding:

- Me in lockdown  
- Stumbled across “how to make a discord bot”  
- Made a few bots  
- Got bored  
- Made more bots anyway  
- Started messing with REST APIs cuz idk why  
- Got hooked on frontend because a friend asked me to make a website  
- Learned more about frontend  
- Started combining frontend + backend for fun  
- Became full-stack for fun  
- End of story

---

## What I generally make:

I mostly create shitpost projects and dump them here since I have wayyy too much free time.  
Check ‘em out if you want, lmao.  
I also make one or two “proper” projects if I’m feeling *✨fancy✨* or if someone asks.

# Tech Stack

```json
{
  "db": "MongoDB",
  "backend": ["Node.js"],
  "frontend": ["Next.js", "Vue.js", "React.js"],
  "sometimes": ["Python (when I’m excruciatingly bored)"]
}
```

## Reach out?

Just by me a coffee and hmu on [IG or smth](https://instagram.com/last._entity)

If you want, I can help you add badges, or a fun “projects” section listing a few repos with weird descriptions?

ps: If all this sounds cooler than it is, don’t worry. I spend most days blankly staring at a terminal, Googling the same error five times in a row, and still somehow end up with the wrong fix anyway.
